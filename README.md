# Hooks-example
Simple react example to show differences between:
1. React classes
2. React classes with context
3. React functional components (with use of context instead of prop-drilling)

## How to run
```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```
Tested on node 16.14.2, npm 8.5.0 and Firefox 98.0.2


## What this is not meant to be
- An example how to write the best performing react app 
- An example of how to write the most maintable react code
- An example of reacts best practices
- An example of how to do I18N (The LanguageText is meant to be bad by design to show prop-drilling)
